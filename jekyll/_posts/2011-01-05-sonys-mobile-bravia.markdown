<p>Interesting that Sony is trying to leverage the Bravia branding to mobile.  Apple sold the world on Retina Display by actually telling us why it was great ("more pixel density than the human eye can distinguish").  Sony is simply leveraging the brand.  That might just be enough if consumers are actually deciding their mobile device purchases based on perceived image quality.  Honestly, I doubt Sony is getting a better screen than Apple since everyone is using the same suppliers out of Taiwan, Korea, and China.</p></div>
