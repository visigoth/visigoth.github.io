    <p>I think every marketer on the planet should read this article.  Most articles on diamonds tend to vilify the players involved, but this article is very level-headed.  It tells a decades-long story, and what I find interesting about it is this deliberate patience of its characters.  They knew it would take a decade to change the public's perception of diamonds, and then yet another one to change it again.  But, they were undeterred and calculated in their efforts.</p></div>
