      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Demo time. Hill is launching U-verse app from iPad for scheduling shows / DVR. New option, ComplemenTV. "So the iPad is basically asked what channel, what show you're on right now." It brings up information and purchase opportunities from Amazon. Now at Home Shopping Network, with the shopping page showing up for the product showing on the screen. Works with recordings, too.</blockquote>
