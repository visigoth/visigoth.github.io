<p>It's a ridiculous notion to expect all content publishers that have encoded their video in h.264 to re-encode their content for WebM just to appease Google.  On top of that, they expect it to happen in only a few months' time!  I am wondering whether YouTube is internally freaking out over this announcement right now: how long will it take them to re-encode all those videos?</p></div>
