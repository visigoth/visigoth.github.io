<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/business/media/30panda.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">This article</a> reminded me that I wanted to write about 3-D movies. <p /> Many people have written about how 3-D won't work due to physiological <br />issues with eye strain and wearing glasses for extended periods of <br />time. While these issues are real, I have faith that technology will <br />get to the point where these issues are mitigated if not eliminated. <p /> Everyone knows that movies are entertainment, and as such, an <br />unnecessary good. The market has already priced out this good: <br />entertain me for about 2 hours and I will pay $10 for that <br />entertainment. Theaters have thus far priced 3-D movies as a marginal <br />good: 3-D is better and thus should be higher value. The only problem <br />is, it isn't (or at best, the margin is short lived). <p /> I wonder if "talkies" demanded a higher ticket price when they were introduced? <p /> Once 3-D movies cost the same as a regular projection, they will <br />simply become the norm at theaters because all the other reasons to go <br />to the theater (timed releases, big screen, popcorn?) will have <br />eroded. The theater is already becoming a throw-away entertainment <br />activity, and 3-D will be the only thing keeping them alive, until the <br />next technology comes along. Personal surround sound, anyone? <p /> ~s
