<p>A great post about a simple algorithm that determines whether a number is prime.  Of course, its simplicity does not imply quick runtime.  Regardless, the algorithm ingeniously uses regex patterns to test for factorization.  The article, I think, is more interesting in that it uncovers a bug in PHP's regular expression matching algorithm as the regex relies on backtracking.</p></div>
