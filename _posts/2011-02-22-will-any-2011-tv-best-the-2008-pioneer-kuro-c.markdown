<p>100% agree.  The last of the Kuro line of plasmas have the best color reproduction and contrast ratio of the plasma generation.  I love this series of televisions and was lucky enough to snag one just after Pioneer <a href="http://gigaom.com/video/pioneers-kuro-killing-a-tipping-point-in-the-plasma-era/">announced their demise</a>.  It was a shame when that happened.
</p><p>Pioneer announced that the Kuro line would <a href="http://www.itwire.com/your-it-news/home-it/44744-pioneer-kuro-goes-elite-but-not-down-under">come back</a>, but in its new form the panels will be manufactured by Sharp and not Pioneer.  I'm looking forward to the first comparison between them and the original line.</p></div>
