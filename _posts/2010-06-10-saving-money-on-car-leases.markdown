About seven years ago, I leased my second car (though it was my first <br />lease). I wasn't very knowledgeable about leases, and like many first <br />timers, I looked at the monthly payment and decided it felt alright. <br />I was lucky enough to afford it and felt like it fit within my budget. <br /> Back then, I was not as fastidious about budgeting my money as I am <br />today. <p /> When the lease on my first car was over, I went back to the dealer to <br />look into leasing the successor to my car. When the dealer showed me <br />the new lease terms, I balked: the monthly payment was quite a bit <br />higher than my previous one, but the car wasn't that much more <br />expensive. While I asked the dealer why that would be, I don't <br />remember his answer - I don't think I would have believed it anyway. <br />So, I went to find out for myself. <p /> After reading a ton of different resources related to car leases, I <br />created a spreadsheet to help me analyze where my money was being <br />spent. In doing so, I figured out the various ways I could save money <br />on the car I wanted. Many years later, I wanted to revisit this topic <br />to present at Ignite Seattle, but the topic wasn't selected by the <br />Ignite coordinators. Regardless, I thought I'd create a simple <br />presentation outlining why it's possible to negotiate a car lease, how <br />car leases work, and what points to negotiate once you've gotten <br />enough data. <p /> Attached to this post are the presentation and the spreadsheet. Try <br />them out and let me know if you find them useful! <p /> ~s<p><div class='p_embed p_file_embed'>
