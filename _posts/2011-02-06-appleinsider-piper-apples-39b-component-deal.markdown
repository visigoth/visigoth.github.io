The analyst also said that the investment could further signal Apple's intention to enter the television market. Munster has believed <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/02/05/apple_planning_connected_television_apple_tv_with_dvr_report.html">for years</a> that Apple will introduce its own HDTV by the end of calendar year 2012 at the earliest.</blockquote>

<p>I've hemmed and hawed at the idea that Apple would create a TV.  For a long time, I was convinced that a 32" panel with Apple TV baked in and the opportunity to purchase an iTunes subscription would be perfect.  However, the lack of a music subscription seemed like a non-starter.  Also, people kept reminding me that TVs are such a cut-throat business that even Apple wouldn't be able to charge its requisite 50% margin on the product.
</p><p>If anything, Apple would make a TV of its own with Apple TV baked in.  With one or two HDMI inputs, I guess that would make a semi-viable product for today's living room - especially when bundled with an iTunes subscription.
</p><p>Apple has pre-bought in its supply chain ever since iPod.  If this $4B investment is in large format LCD screens, I would definitely believe a real Apple TV is coming.</p></div>
