<p>Completely agree; motion does suck in movies.  Perfectionists like myself spend huge amounts of time and money seeking to remove the vertical tearing that is so easy to see on 24fps film content when the camera pans horizontally.  This is especially disappointing in otherwise epic scenes such as landscape pans in movies like Lord of the Rings or documentaries like Planet Earth.
