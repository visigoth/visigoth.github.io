<a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20100920/what-does-apple-want-with-rovi/?mod=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">This article</a> points out that Apple may be holding back its development of the features I previously mentioned.  I tend to agree - there&#39;s only one way for Apple (or someone) to go, and that is to build an all-inclusive device that finally gets rid of your cable box, DVD player and potentially game consoles.  If you want to take over the TV, that&#39;s what you gotta do.<p /> ~s
