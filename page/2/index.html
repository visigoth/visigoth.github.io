      <p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/28/no-airplay-is-not-the-new-apple-tv/">This TechCrunch
article</a>,
written by David McIntosh of Redux, insists that AirPlay is not the
new Apple TV.  However, it starts from a flawed assumption that Apple
would need to license the technology to many TV manufacturers.</p>

<p>The only technology Apple has really cared to license is the dock
connector, and that was specifically to get an accessory ecosystem
going in order to sell more devices.  Integrating with TVs isn&rsquo;t going
to sell more devices, because the users that would buy such a
television already have a device.  The only immediate incentive Apple
has to license the technology is to collect a hefty licensing fee, but
that doesn&rsquo;t amount to much.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that licensing fee is $100 per unit (which no TV
manufacturer is going to pay, but let&rsquo;s give Apple the benefit of the
doubt).  There were <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/14/business/la-fi-tn-tv-shipments-20120314">250
million</a>
television shipments last year.  That&rsquo;s a maximum of $24 billion per
year, and we know the per-unit fee and the share of TVs using the
technology would be much smaller.  And with TV shipments falling year
over year, that number would decrease over time.  For a company that
does $13 billion a month in revenue, this is quickly becoming chump
change.</p>

<p>Another indirect incentive for Apple to license AirPlay would be to
increase revenue for iTunes content.  But, iTunes was always a ploy to
attract people to purchasing Apple devices, not vice-versa.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still of the opinion that Apple&rsquo;s going to build a TV of its own
and sell it to the richest consumers who already are invested in
Apple&rsquo;s media ecosystem.</p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Mac OS X Lion supports a new Cocoa object called <code>NSPopover</code>.  This object
acts a lot like the popover introduced in CocoaTouch on iPad.  There are
lots of places normal applications can use <code>NSPopover</code> naturally.  I
recently started working on a personal project that uses an <code>NSStatusItem</code>,
and wanted to use an <code>NSPopover</code> to manage the primary user interface for
the content shown when interacting with the <code>NSStatusItem</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the interactions between a hidden object called
<code>NSPopoverWindow</code> and Mac OS X&rsquo;s <code>NSStatusBarWindow</code> create some problems.
 On top of this, having an <code>NSPopover</code> where the content view contains edit
fields creates further problems.</p>

<p>However, I was finally able to get the interactions working correctly (at
the expense of using the built-in <code>NSPopoverBehavior</code> styles).  This post
takes you through the problems and describes my solutions.</p>

<p>Yes, I could have used the <a href="https://github.com/shpakovski/Popup/tree/master/Popup">Popup</a> project, but I just
wanted to make <code>NSPopover</code> work.</p>

<h2>Initial Code</h2>

<p>The initial code is pretty simple: just create a custom view and attach it
to an <code>NSStatusItem</code> object.  Even though I did not need more than the
functionality provided by the default <code>NSStatusItem</code> object, <code>NSPopover</code>
requires a view for the <code>showRelativeToRect:ofView:preferredEdge:</code>
selector.  I couldn&rsquo;t figure out a way to access the <code>_fView</code> member of the
<code>NSStatusItem</code> that&rsquo;s visible in the debugger, so I was stuck
re-implementing the basic <code>NSStatusItem</code> view functionality of an image
that flips when activated.  I call this <code>BRStatusItemIconView</code>.  The code
in the application delegate looks like this:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>NSStatusItem* statusItem = [[NSStatusBar systemStatusBar]
  statusItemWithLength:32];
[statusItem setHighlightMode:YES];

_iconView = [[BRStatusItemIconView alloc]
  initWithStatusItem:statusItem];
_iconView.image = [NSImage imageNamed:@&quot;Status&quot;];
_iconView.highlightedImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@&quot;StatusHighlighted&quot;];</pre></div>
</div>

<p>The <code>initWithStatusItem:</code> selector creates the necessary subviews (since
it&rsquo;s not loaded from a nib) and attaches itself to <code>statusItem</code> through
<code>setView:</code>.</p>

<p>I used a separate object to be the popover controller and attach itself to
the <code>NSStatusItem</code>.  Since I used a custom view, the <code>action</code> and <code>target</code>
properties of the <code>NSStatusItem</code> couldn&rsquo;t be used.  I created a
<code>BRStatusItemIconViewDelegate</code> protocol that had one selector:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>- (void)activated:(BRStatusItemIconView*)sender;</pre></div>
</div>

<p>When the icon was clicked, it would invoke this selector on a delegate.  My
<code>BRStatusItemPopoverController</code> object is the popover&rsquo;s controller and
attaches itself to the <code>BRStatusIconView</code> created in the application
delegate.  The popover was initialized like this:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>_popover = [[NSPopover alloc] init];
_popover.behavior = NSPopoverBehaviorApplicationDefined;
_popover.contentViewController = viewController;
_popover.delegate = self;
_popover.animates = NO;</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Note I used <code>NSPopoverBehaviorApplicationDefined</code>, the importance of which
will be discussed later.  The <code>viewController</code> here was a controller for a
complex view that includes an edit field, which is also important to note.</p>

<p>So, now all I needed was to open and close the <code>NSPopover</code>!  The simple
version of the code in <code>BRStatusItemPopoverController</code> looked like this:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>- (void)close {
  [_popover close];
  _shown = NO;
}

- (void)open {
  BRStatusItemIconView* view = _statusItem.view;
  [_popover showRelativeToRect:view.bounds ofView:view
    preferredEdge:NSMaxYEdge];
  _shown = YES;
}

- (void)activated:(BRStatusItemIconView*)sender {
  if (_shown) {
    [self close];
  } else {
    [self open];
  }
}</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Hit run to try it out, and&hellip; it works!  However, if the popover&rsquo;s content
view contained an <code>NSTextField</code>, you&rsquo;d find that the field refuses to
become first responder!  Even making sure the field was marked editable in
Interface Builder didn&rsquo;t help.  #FAIL.</p>

<h2>Fixing Edit Fields</h2>

<p>According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7214273/nstextfield-on-nspopover">this</a>
StackOverflow question, the problem with the <code>NSTextField</code> is the parent
window&rsquo;s inability to become the key window.  The answer in that question
is to write a global category for your application:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>NSWindow+canBecomeKeyWindow.h
@interface NSWindow (canBecomeKeyWindow)

@end

NSWindow+canBecomeKeyWindow.m
@implementation NSWindow (canBecomeKeyWindow)

//This is to fix a bug with 10.7 where an NSPopover with a text field
//cannot be edited if its parent window won't become key
//The pragma statements disable the corresponding warning for
//overriding an already-implemented method
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored &quot;-Wobjc-protocol-method-implementation&quot;
- (BOOL)canBecomeKeyWindow
{
    return YES;
}
#pragma clang diagnostic pop

@end</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Trying this out appears to work when you click the status item.  You can
click the <code>NSTextField</code> and it becomes editable!  But, this has created a
subtle problem: the status item only works correctly if the application
that owns it is active.  When inactive, the status item weirdly requires a
double click to activate it, and even then, the double click sends two
<code>mouseDown:</code> events to <code>BRStatusItemIconView</code>, causing the interaction to
be out of phase with the user&rsquo;s intention.</p>

<h2>Fixing the double click</h2>

<p>Long story short, we need to control when the <code>NSStatusBarWindow</code> window,
the parent of <code>BRStatusItemIconView</code>, is allowed to become key.  When the
popover is opened, we want that to happen so that the popover&rsquo;s content
view can become first responder.  When the popover is closed, we want to go
back to the original behavior so that input to <code>BRStatusItemIconView</code>
doesn&rsquo;t get blocked.  But, we aren&rsquo;t familiar with the original behavior
because it&rsquo;s hidden by the original implementation of
<code>canBecomeKeyWindow:</code>.  Using a technique called <a href="http://cocoadev.com/?MethodSwizzling">method swizzling</a> that helps us do this.  Note that
there is an updated version of method swizzling discussed <a href="http://kevin.sb.org/2006/12/30/method-swizzling-reimplemented/">here</a>, but I&rsquo;ve
not implemented it in my code yet.  The new code looks like this:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>#import &quot;NSWindow_canBecomeKeyWindow.h&quot;
#include

BOOL shouldBecomeKeyWindow;
NSWindow* windowToOverride;

@implementation NSWindow (canBecomeKeyWindow)

//This is to fix a bug with 10.7 where an NSPopover with a text field
//cannot be edited if its parent window won't become key
//The pragma statements disable the corresponding warning for
//overriding an already-implemented method
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored &quot;-Wobjc-protocol-method-implementation&quot;
- (BOOL)popoverCanBecomeKeyWindow
{
    if (self == windowToOverride) {
        return shouldBecomeKeyWindow;
    } else {
        return [self popoverCanBecomeKeyWindow];
    }
}

+ (void)load
{
    method_exchangeImplementations(
      class_getInstanceMethod(self, @selector(canBecomeKeyWindow)),
      class_getInstanceMethod(self, @selector(popoverCanBecomeKeyWindow)));
}
#pragma clang diagnostic pop

@end</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Now, <code>shouldBecomeKeyWindow</code> and <code>windowToOverride</code> just need to be set
correctly.  As I said above, we want <code>windowToOverride</code> to be the
<code>NSStatusBarWindow</code> and <code>shouldBecomeKeyWindow</code> to change based on the
status of the popover being visible.  The new
<code>BRStatusItemPopoverController</code> code is this:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>- (void)close
{
    [_popover close];
    shouldBecomeKeyWindow = NO;
    _shown = NO;
}

- (void)open
{
    BRStatusItemIconView* view = (BRStatusItemIconView*)_statusItem.view;

    shouldBecomeKeyWindow = YES;
    [_popover showRelativeToRect:view.bounds ofView:view
      preferredEdge:NSMaxYEdge];

    windowToOverride = view.window;
    [view.window becomeKeyWindow];
    _shown = YES;
}</pre></div>
</div>

<h2>Adding transient behavior</h2>

<p>Finally!  Things work as they should.  However, one cool thing about
<code>NSPopover</code>&rsquo;s default functionality is its ability to be a transient
presence for the user.  For applications that use the status bar, this is
good behavior.  However, because <code>NSPopoverBehaviorApplicationDefined</code> was
used, we have to duplicate that functionality.  Basically, we want the
popover to be able to disappear when the application resigns being active.
 This can be done by listening to the appropriate notifications in
<code>BRStatusItemPopoverController</code> and changing the ability of the
<code>NSStatusBarWindow</code> to become key, or close the popover.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>- (void)applicationDidResignActive:(NSNotification*)n
{
    if ((self.behavior == BRStatusItemPopoverBehaviorTransient) &amp;&amp;
       _shown) {
        [self close];
    } else if (self.behavior == BRStatusItemPopoverBehaviorPermanent) {
        shouldBecomeKeyWindow = NO;
    }
}</pre></div>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Apple has some bugs to fix related to <code>NSPopover</code> and <code>NSStatusBarWindow</code>.
 It seems obvious to me that applications that live in the status bar
should use <code>NSPopover</code> to present complex user interfaces, but the
complexity of doing so right now is too high.</p>

 When I wrote what I thought Apple TV should have been, I thought
things like a CableCARD DVR and a DVD player would be key features for
me to buy it.  If I could be Apple in 2011 designing a TV, I think I&rsquo;d
do it this way:</p>

<h2>Industrial Design</h2>

<p>Televisions are known for black or grey bezels with various curves,
markings, buttons, LEDs, grills (for speakers) and technology
brandings.  Some of these are functional, while others are meant to
distinguish them from the competition.  I would think Apple will
either borrow from the glass &amp; white plastic bezel of iOS devices, or
borrow from the brushed aluminum motif of the Cinema Display.  The
bezel itself will be clean; there might be one LED on it to indicate
it is on, though I doubt even that.  I&rsquo;m guessing there will only be a
power button, because you won&rsquo;t need to control the device at the TV
itself.  Apple won&rsquo;t need any branding on the device other than its
own logo, and I think the rest of the design will be so clean for a TV
that people won&rsquo;t mistake it for anything but the Apple TV if it
didn&rsquo;t have that either.</p>

<h2>Photo Frame</h2>

<p>It used to be that people adorned their walls at home with beautiful
art.  Then, the television came along and ruined everything: the
center of attention became a garish box rather than a piece of art.
Considering the industrial design of the TV itself is likely going to
be quite nice, it seems it would go to waste if it was off all the
time.  I could see Apple extending their iPad photo frame
functionality to the television, where it automatically starts showing
content while it&rsquo;s on but not playing anything.  Alternatively, you
could manually start it by holding/touching the power button.</p>

<h2>Inputs &amp; Outputs</h2>

<p>I would put four connectors on this device: power, HDMI in, HDMI out,
and a network adapter.  Unfortunately, no one has invented wireless
power that can supply the wattage a television needs, so that one has
to be there.  HDMI out is an easy one: if you&rsquo;re a home theater nut,
you&rsquo;ll want to hear the audio through your speaker setup.  The network
adapter is understandable for the case where wifi isn&rsquo;t available or
has low signal quality.  Finally, when it comes to HDMI in, my logic
goes like this: either you are a simple consumer that has a cable box
and perhaps a DVD player, or you are a home theater nut and you have
lots of components and a receiver.  If you&rsquo;re the former category,
Apple wants to replace at least one of those boxes.  For these people,
Apple might automatically switch to the HDMI in signal when it detects
something is on.  That way, if you want to use your cable box or DVD
player, you only have to turn it on and not futz with some other
mechanism.  If you&rsquo;re in the latter category, you&rsquo;ll use the receiver
to switch between inputs.</p>

<p>Apple might throw in an IR receiver just as a throw back to people who
have the old Apple remote.</p>

<h2>Remote Control</h2>

<p>I mentioned that there wouldn&rsquo;t be any buttons on the device if I were
to design it.  I believe Apple will place remote command and control
on iOS devices.  iPhone and iPod Touch users will get a simple
experience for command and control.  It depends on the content service
that goes along with the device, but if they provide a cable-style
service, I could see a simple electronic program guide primarily
driven by search.  iPad users will get a better experience: a natural
electronic program guide due to the device&rsquo;s larger screen.</p>

<h2>AirPlay</h2>

<p>More importantly, Apple will recognize that discovery and consumption
lie in two different places.  The TV display is great for consumption,
but the human interface for discovery has always been poor, especially
on archaic cable boxes.  Many people think Siri will be an important
part of Apple TV&rsquo;s value proposition, but I&rsquo;m not convinced of it.
Rather, Apple already has a great, reconfigurable remote control in
iOS devices.  iOS 5&rsquo;s ability to use AirPlay wirelessly will enable
Apple to create a discovery experience that leverages the TV so that
the family doesn&rsquo;t have to huddle around an iPhone or iPad, but the
primary interaction will take place on one of those devices.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The only reason I could see Apple making the screen a touchscreen is
for configuring its networking.  However, I don&rsquo;t think they will do
that.  <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/12/11/apple-planning-to-add-bluetooth-support-for-airplay-and-expand-ios-accessory-capabilities/">This article</a>
sounds very prescient.  Configuration over bluetooth from an iOS
device would be understandable for so many people, it makes the most
sense.  Alternatively, for people who use wired ethernet instead,
they&rsquo;ll be able to use iTunes from their computer to perform the
configuration and then disconnect the cable if they desire.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>I honestly have no idea what Apple is going to do with content.
Everyone is expecting some amazing cable-style subscription service.
I have to question whether that will happen because Apple couldn&rsquo;t
compete on price with cable companies since the media companies are
not going to be fooled into giving Apple preferential deal terms.  At
least, I would think they wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

      <p>In the three months that I have not written on this blog, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/18/its-official-hp-kills-off-webos-phones-and-the-touchpad/">HP killed
webOS</a>,
<a href="http://amazon.com/kindle">Amazon became a real device maker</a>, and
<a href="http://apple.com/stevejobs">Steve Jobs passed away</a>.  Technology
really does move fast &ndash; I already have to <a href="http://blog.brokenrobotllc.com/how-hp-became-2">eat my words regarding
HP</a>.  I still think
HP&rsquo;s strategy held water, but it was Mark Hurd&rsquo;s strategy and not in
Leo Apothekar&rsquo;s playbook.</p>

<p>The thing that got me excited enough to write something again was the
announcement of <a href="http://nest.com">nest labs' thermostat</a>.  Now that
the edges of technology have pushed communication forward, it&rsquo;s time
that it helped the every day activities with which we are already
familiar.  nest is a great name because, to me, it obviously implies
the grandiose nature of the company&rsquo;s goals: to change the
technologies used within our homes every day to be more efficient.</p>

<p>A direction I think nest will go in the future is fridges.  <a href="http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/13/30-of-all-worlds-food-goes-to-waste/">30% of
food is wasted</a>,
and a good portion comes from fridges at home.  Remember being
promised a fridge that would know when food had gone bad and ordered
more groceries?  Seems like something that could be done in the
future.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got high hopes for nest: The world needs people who are willing
to bring design and usability to products that live in perpetual
mediocrity.  We can&rsquo;t wait for Apple to get bored with media
consumption to go start building smart lamps.</p>
