      <p>Making TVs has always been a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/blogs/eyeonasia/archives/2009/01/sony_revamps_tv_biz_warns_of_annual_losses.html">tough business</a>.  Because the TV itself stopped being a novelty a long time ago, TV manufacturers have had to resort to enticing users to upgrade their TVs every few years or so.  After all, if your current TV works just fine, why would you need a new one?<p /> One of Sony&#39;s greatest strengths is being on both sides of the equation: Sony produces lots of content, and one of its major distribution channels is television.  They also make TVs, which they want to keep selling to consumers.  In order to keep selling TVs, new features must be added to make previous TVs less interesting.  Sometimes, these new features require content producers to use them (e.g. high definition or 3D content).  For most content distribution businesses, this becomes a chicken and egg problem: without content that uses them, device features are useless and vice versa.<p /> Very few features make it to the mass market.  High definition (encompassing screens, connectors, players and content) is just about the only success story over the past decade.  Niche features such as whole-home control mechanisms, universal remote controls, and all-in-one player &amp; speaker units eventually end up in the feature graveyard where they die a slow death.  Deeper features such as high-end video smoothing techniques never even enter the vernacular (or confuse consumers if they do) and eventually make it to common chips used by all manufacturers within a couple of years of their invention.  In either of these cases, the mass market is not willing to pay any margin for these features.<p /> However, there is someone willing to pay for them while there is margin to be had: early adopters.  These consumers are the lifeblood of this industry.  The newest such features they are willing to pay for are 3D and TV-based apps.  The former is an example of features that require hardware, while the latter are of course software.  I am not sure about the fate of 3D.  However, I&#39;m going to posit that TV apps are a graveyard technology.<p /> A lot of extended functionality in TVs come from boxes connected to them: Xbox, PlayStation, Wii, TiVo, Apple TV, Media Center PCs, etc.  Each of these boxes come with proprietary platforms to lock in experiences.  More and more, however, publishers of these experiences are finding the opportunity cost of being locked is too high.  Video game publishers were first: there are very few experiences exclusive to any platform whereas it was common many years ago.  App creators will realize the same thing.  TVs on their own are yet more platforms for which to publish wares.  But, let&#39;s face it, TV manufacturers are not operating system developers.  Their best bet is to use a baked platform such as Android to provide this functionality, though none of them have realized this yet.<p /> Let&#39;s take a step back.  Why would consumers want this?  They want content on a big screen, sure.  But, do they need this technology to get it there?  I don&#39;t think so at all: with technology like AirPlay, it doesn&#39;t even make sense.  If all the content I want is being published to the device in my hand, and that device can put it on the screen in front of me, there is no reason for the latter to have a built-in experience at all.  This even side steps the issue of which account your TV represents: yours? your wife&#39;s?<p /> Google TV is a fail because it is trying to solve a problem that people have today rather than a problem people will have tomorrow - more on that later.<p />Eventually, the only thing consumers will be willing to pay for is a big screen on a wall.  That screen shouldn&#39;t even have connectors or tuners.  It should just let you stream stuff from your device.  Even that may go away if projection technology becomes good enough to the point where <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/05/27/hi-lux-pico-projector-phone-for-174-ok-ill-bite/">pico projectors</a> have the oomph of regular ones.<p /> ~s</p>

<p>When Zune first got started, I was desperately hoping to link its functionality with Xbox: both would be on the same network at home and the Zune offered the best device at the time to be able to control my Xbox's functionality.  Why ship a remote with the console when you could control it with the portable device that's already in your hand?</p>
<p>While I hacked up a prototype a number of years ago controlling my Xbox devkit from my PC, I never got enough traction between the two teams.  I wish I could have explained better why I think it was a critical mistake not making these two devices work well together, but I'm going to try to do so ex post facto:</p>
<p>Say my <a href="http://blog.brokenrobotllc.com/dumb-tvs-are-the-future">dumb TV idea</a> comes true.  As I've said before, the ability to transport your media is very valuable.  AirPlay is the best technology available to do this today.  Some day, everything might be streamed from the Internet, and Apple has created a brand and associated technology that users would trust no matter how the delivery of the bits happens.  What will make users comfortable with the experience of transporting media will be their early use of AirPlay enabled devices.</p>
<p>It might not take that long for others to catch up.  After all, Windows has ad-hoc networking technology also.  However, users will have invested in an ecosystem they will not want to leave.</p>

<p>This is huge, and it's likely that Apple will enable this for themselves in an iOS update at some point.&nbsp; I can't count how many times I've browsed video on my laptop with others around only to wish I could throw it onto my TV.</p>

<p>The more I think about it, could we have a future where TVs don't have inputs?&nbsp; They would be simple streaming clients to which other devices push content.&nbsp; You've got your phone with you - why would you need anything else?</p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p>One of the trickiest problems of bringing applications and tons of content to TV is that of search: finding the right content at the right time.  Xbox solved it through what is hopefully an intuitive, if sometimes dull, UI: Video marketplace, games marketplace, in-game content marketplaces, Netflix, etc. are menu-driven experiences that expose long lists of content to the user.  While it has nice animations and 3d perspective, it&#39;s still a list of titles.  PlayStation has similar designs, as does Apple on Apple TV.  Google, on the other hand, has focused on text search as a content discovery solution.  At first glance, that seems like a truly fresh approach to the problem.  After all, I find lots of content that way on the web.<p /> However, as Google is finding out right now, the problem is in getting text onto the screen: who wants to sit with a keyboard on her lap while on the couch?  I just left my keyboard at work; I don&#39;t want to see another one when I get home to relax!  The new Sony Google TV has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/05/google-tv-remote/">a horrendous remote</a> that will <i>not</i> be winning over any critics.  Xbox also has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Text-Messaging-Kit/dp/B000UN3UDQ">text entry attachment</a> for its controllers, but it&#39;s completely optional and very much likely that 90% of the user base doesn&#39;t know it exists (let alone need it to enter text).<p /> What most of these system implementers are missing is that many users (especially ones likely to get a fancy Internet TV) already have great text entry devices in their hands: a smartphone.  There is only one reason not to leverage that fact: accessories.  For Xbox (and other traditional hardware manufacturers), accessories are a source of major profit, overcoming the console&#39;s loss and thus making money for the venture as a whole.  However, these accessories attach at about 5% in successful scenarios.  That means 95% of your user base doesn&#39;t see the value of the scenario that you&#39;re solving through the accessory.  One might wonder why you went ahead and developed the code behind that scenario in the first place, but that&#39;s a whole other discussion.  My point is that, while accessories are profitable, your ultimate goal should be to enable great scenarios and accessories aren&#39;t helping 95% of your users.<p /> But, let&#39;s take the theory a step further.  Is there a reason to use the smartphone as a text entry device?  Not really.  What I truly want to do is manipulate the content on the big screen.  The smartphone (or tablet?) in front of me is already efficient at fine-grained interactions like search &amp; browse.  The TV is really good at one thing: throwing sound &amp; video at me (and those around me) with the highest fidelity available.  The best thing technology can do in this situation is <i>get out of the way</i>, and the best way for it to do that is to put everything right in front of the user on a smaller device.<p /> I want to call this &quot;side channel interaction,&quot; and it&#39;s uniquely appropriate for a living room situation.  While the interaction challenges of getting text to the screen are daunting, the social aspect of TV means that side channel interaction is also more appropriate.  If you could browse what&#39;s on TV without disturbing everyone else, that&#39;s interesting.  If you all could play Jeopardy! without having to scream out the answer before people had time to think, that&#39;s interesting.  If you could collaboratively edit the video from your vacation without crowding around a desktop, that&#39;s interesting.  Imagine being able to get rid of TV advertising entirely by using the side channel to monetize.  Each person in the room could get a personalized ad through notifications that sync with the video content.<p /> Apple has started to use the side channel with <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/">AirPlay</a>, which enables you to &#39;flick&#39; content from your phone to the TV screen through Apple TV.  What enabled them to build that was their investment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_%28software%29">Bonjour networking</a> a very long time ago.  Other operating systems (like Windows and Linux) have implementations of Bonjour, but AirPlay has built-in cryptographic keys that prevent just anyone from being a part of the AirPlay ecosystem.<p /> Even if you&#39;re not Apple, it&#39;s <a href="http://blog.tysonwilliams.com/2010/09/19/abc-app-listens-to-your-tv-to-sync-interactive-content/">possible have side channel interaction with TV</a>.  This kind of technology is super cool, but it&#39;s a workaround for what is really needed: smart televisions that know the magic is not on the big screen, but actually on the screen right in front of you.  As Apple has shown with Apple TV, the smarts don&#39;t have to be in the TV itself, either.<p /> In my opinion, Xbox, PlayStation, and Google all have a #fail on their hands until they can interact with mobile devices seamlessly.  Xbox would tell you Kinect will usher in an era of natural user interfaces.  While I love Kinect and the people that made the impossible happen (I even got to work on the project just a little bit) , I think laziness will play a trump card: when I can flick my finger on my personal device, why make larger movements with my hands?<p /> ~s</p>
