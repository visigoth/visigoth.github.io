    <section class="post-content">
      <p>I&#39;ve been working on my latest project since April.  That is a long time, but life gets in the way.  Regardless, this period of time means that my app has had to make the transition to iOS 4.2.  If you&#39;ll recall my <a href="http://blog.brokenrobotllc.com/ios-cached-image-loaders">post about caching media</a>, my app loads a fair amount of media from the web and displays it all to the user.  On iOS 3.2, the images I was loading would gradually show up on the screen one by one.  Once I upgraded my iPad to 4.2, this functionality suddenly changed: the images would load all together at once.  This is bad because it takes a long time to display, decode, and render these images.  The user would have to wait many seconds before they were seen.  Since my app is so visual, this was unacceptable, so I started debugging.<p /> My first inclination was that something might have changed about how the resources were being downloaded due to differences in the way NSOperation was being handled.  I placed a bunch of debug output to find out that images were downloading the same way as before, so the problem was happening after I set the image property of the target UIImageView.<p /> I wrestled with what could be happening for a while until I realized that I was setting the property on a thread other than the UI thread.  I was also setting it within an @synchronized block.  So, I thought the lock might be causing the problem.  However, I found the entire locked area was taking 4ms of time.  When you have synchronous debug prints coming over a channel, this is a small amount of time.  So, Apple had changed the way image rendering was happening to queue things up to run in some batched run loop mode on the UI thread.<p /> I ran with this and changed the rendering operation to flip the render over to the main thread with performSelectorOnMainThread.  It worked!  I was lucky that this solved the problem as it was only a hunch.  While I had played around with performSelectorOnMainThread before, I found memory management with it is tricky and so I had stayed away from it.  I&#39;m sure there are some reference counting issues in the code now as a result of the change.<p /> Lesson learned: on iOS, perform UI changes on the main thread only.  The pain of retainCount management is worth it.<p />~s</p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p>I've got a Mac project I'm working on that required a scalable viewport into another view. &nbsp;Because the viewport could be a scaled version of the target view, it also needs to be scrollable. &nbsp;This sort of pattern is seen a lot in editing applications and web browsers. &nbsp;Specifically, I was looking to mimic the iPhone Simulator app. &nbsp;It took me about 10 hours of wrangling cocoa to get it to do what I wanted. &nbsp;I tried writing a custom NSClipView among other tactics, but what I found to work in the end was pretty simple.&nbsp; This technique should transfer to iOS readily.<p /> To scale the view you're inspecting, you'll likely use NSView's scaleUnitSquareToSize: selector.&nbsp; This will render the view's contents using Quartz scaling algorithms.&nbsp; However, it will not change the frame/bounds of the view.&nbsp; This is where the crux of the problem lies - the scroll extents of the scroll view would not change.&nbsp; When scaled up, the scroll view would not scroll enough of the view to see all of it.&nbsp; When scaled down, the scroll view would scroll too far and show emptiness on the sides of the document.<p /> To work around this, we will create a new document view that advertises the correct frame to the scroll view.&nbsp; It will host the true document view as a subview, without clipping it and without autoresize enabled.&nbsp; It will monitor the document view's frame and adjust accordingly.&nbsp; It will also need to know the scale of the document view, and the easiest way to handle that is to have this new host view control the scale of the document.&nbsp; Here's all the code you need:<p /> <a href="https://gist.github.com/715903">https://gist.github.com/715903/e11a0afe4245fa697e5660d4fc887eae08275bec</a><p />Once you have this code, you can call setDocumentView: on any scroll view with a HostView.&nbsp; When you need to change the scale, call setScale: (or use the property accessor) on the HostView.&nbsp; The scroll view will adjust its scroll bars accordingly.<p /> Note, however, that the scroll view's frame will not change - the scroll view's size will be the same, but the scroll bars will reflect the correct amount of data that is visible.&nbsp; If you want the scroll view to adjust its size correctly to fit the document, you will need to add some more monitoring to the document's frame size and adjust accordingly outside of the scroll view itself.<p /> ~s</p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Once you develop a media-rich project or two where you end up loading a bunch of smaller resources that may or may not be visible to the user at any given time (experiences like email, image galleries, and video games fit this description), you realize that having a dynamic cache of these resources is necessary to make the user's experience fluid. &nbsp;This is because available memory is smaller than the amount needed to keep all resources in memory at once, thus available for rendering at any time. &nbsp;However, you don't want an upper layer view (as in the MVC pattern) to manage or deal with the details of what does &amp; doesn't fit in memory: the abstraction it should deal with is to fetch and display the information. &nbsp;Additional complexity would be added when multiple views simultaneously manage these resources.<p /> Instead of thinking about keeping resources in memory, maybe we can simply fetch them every time they are needed by a view? &nbsp;Usually, these resources require some transformation before being displayed (decompression, color palette lookups, etc.) or they are very latent in their retrieval (stored on a DVD or on the internet behind a URL). &nbsp;Media rich applications typically need to support some form of animation or other dynamism with these resources - updating these resources in response to animation requires keeping them around in their transformed formats. &nbsp;When animations run every 16ms (at 60 frames per second), and resource retrieval and transformation can take hundreds of milliseconds, fetching every time a resource is needed is not a valid solution. <p /> So, a layer between views and resources is needed. &nbsp;This cache would be responsible for fetching resources as requested by views and transforming them to a usable state before handing them back to the view. &nbsp;Since the fetch and transformation is very latent, the cache remains in an indeterminate state between the first request and the completion of the fetch. &nbsp;Either the cache or view can decide what to do in this case by showing a placeholder resource, or waiting until the fetch is complete. &nbsp;Since it's a cache, there is also an eviction policy. &nbsp;This could be size-related, or time-related. &nbsp;For software programs that could cache their resources across sessions (such as web browsers), having the cache backed by storage is important. &nbsp;Most any software programmer should be familiar with these concepts.<p /> So why write a blog post about it? &nbsp;In iOS, Apple has provided a great many libraries to create media-rich applications: CoreAnimation, CoreImage, etc. &nbsp;But, a resource cache abstraction that is backed by application-owned storage is curiously missing. &nbsp;Of course, the community has filled the gap, but this is code that only really needs to be solved once as most applications in this style have very similar use cases. &nbsp;An especially interesting scenario is an application browsing a bunch of images downloaded from the Internet. &nbsp;This isn't narrowly scoped to photo album viewers, but includes apps that show box art or product photos, for example.<p /> <a href="http://davidgolightly.blogspot.com/2009/02/asynchronous-image-caching-with-iphone.html">This post</a> details a great solution in code.&nbsp; A commenter created <a href="http://github.com/rs/SDWebImage">this github repository</a> with a cohesive implementation that includes a UIImageView protocol category that helps you use this kind of caching transparently.&nbsp; If your app has anything to do with downloading lots of images, I highly recommend using this library or writing your own based on the details from the linked post.<p /> ~s</p>
