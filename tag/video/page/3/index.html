    <section class="post-content">
      <p>One of the trickiest problems of bringing applications and tons of content to TV is that of search: finding the right content at the right time.  Xbox solved it through what is hopefully an intuitive, if sometimes dull, UI: Video marketplace, games marketplace, in-game content marketplaces, Netflix, etc. are menu-driven experiences that expose long lists of content to the user.  While it has nice animations and 3d perspective, it&#39;s still a list of titles.  PlayStation has similar designs, as does Apple on Apple TV.  Google, on the other hand, has focused on text search as a content discovery solution.  At first glance, that seems like a truly fresh approach to the problem.  After all, I find lots of content that way on the web.<p /> However, as Google is finding out right now, the problem is in getting text onto the screen: who wants to sit with a keyboard on her lap while on the couch?  I just left my keyboard at work; I don&#39;t want to see another one when I get home to relax!  The new Sony Google TV has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/05/google-tv-remote/">a horrendous remote</a> that will <i>not</i> be winning over any critics.  Xbox also has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Text-Messaging-Kit/dp/B000UN3UDQ">text entry attachment</a> for its controllers, but it&#39;s completely optional and very much likely that 90% of the user base doesn&#39;t know it exists (let alone need it to enter text).<p /> What most of these system implementers are missing is that many users (especially ones likely to get a fancy Internet TV) already have great text entry devices in their hands: a smartphone.  There is only one reason not to leverage that fact: accessories.  For Xbox (and other traditional hardware manufacturers), accessories are a source of major profit, overcoming the console&#39;s loss and thus making money for the venture as a whole.  However, these accessories attach at about 5% in successful scenarios.  That means 95% of your user base doesn&#39;t see the value of the scenario that you&#39;re solving through the accessory.  One might wonder why you went ahead and developed the code behind that scenario in the first place, but that&#39;s a whole other discussion.  My point is that, while accessories are profitable, your ultimate goal should be to enable great scenarios and accessories aren&#39;t helping 95% of your users.<p /> But, let&#39;s take the theory a step further.  Is there a reason to use the smartphone as a text entry device?  Not really.  What I truly want to do is manipulate the content on the big screen.  The smartphone (or tablet?) in front of me is already efficient at fine-grained interactions like search &amp; browse.  The TV is really good at one thing: throwing sound &amp; video at me (and those around me) with the highest fidelity available.  The best thing technology can do in this situation is <i>get out of the way</i>, and the best way for it to do that is to put everything right in front of the user on a smaller device.<p /> I want to call this &quot;side channel interaction,&quot; and it&#39;s uniquely appropriate for a living room situation.  While the interaction challenges of getting text to the screen are daunting, the social aspect of TV means that side channel interaction is also more appropriate.  If you could browse what&#39;s on TV without disturbing everyone else, that&#39;s interesting.  If you all could play Jeopardy! without having to scream out the answer before people had time to think, that&#39;s interesting.  If you could collaboratively edit the video from your vacation without crowding around a desktop, that&#39;s interesting.  Imagine being able to get rid of TV advertising entirely by using the side channel to monetize.  Each person in the room could get a personalized ad through notifications that sync with the video content.<p /> Apple has started to use the side channel with <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/">AirPlay</a>, which enables you to &#39;flick&#39; content from your phone to the TV screen through Apple TV.  What enabled them to build that was their investment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_%28software%29">Bonjour networking</a> a very long time ago.  Other operating systems (like Windows and Linux) have implementations of Bonjour, but AirPlay has built-in cryptographic keys that prevent just anyone from being a part of the AirPlay ecosystem.<p /> Even if you&#39;re not Apple, it&#39;s <a href="http://blog.tysonwilliams.com/2010/09/19/abc-app-listens-to-your-tv-to-sync-interactive-content/">possible have side channel interaction with TV</a>.  This kind of technology is super cool, but it&#39;s a workaround for what is really needed: smart televisions that know the magic is not on the big screen, but actually on the screen right in front of you.  As Apple has shown with Apple TV, the smarts don&#39;t have to be in the TV itself, either.<p /> In my opinion, Xbox, PlayStation, and Google all have a #fail on their hands until they can interact with mobile devices seamlessly.  Xbox would tell you Kinect will usher in an era of natural user interfaces.  While I love Kinect and the people that made the impossible happen (I even got to work on the project just a little bit) , I think laziness will play a trump card: when I can flick my finger on my personal device, why make larger movements with my hands?<p /> ~s</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Over the past many months, I&#39;ve been working on a Netflix iPad app in my available time.  I originally had the idea for what I&#39;m trying to achieve with my app since before iPad was released, though I never had time to execute on it until recently.  As with many of my personal projects, this one stemmed from personal frustrations I had with other Netflix apps on iPad.  These apps all share some key problems around design, information architecture, and performance.<p /> There are only a few apps for Netflix available on iPad (if you don&#39;t count the iPhone apps that run on the device).  The two prominent ones that let you edit your queue and add new content to it are MovieBuddy and iPhlixHD.  I was instantly turned off by MovieBuddy&#39;s gaudy animated graphics and slow performance in loading recommendations.  iPhlixHD, on the other hand, is a very slick app, but its paradigm basically transposes the Netflix API into a menu system.  This hides information the user could use up front to determine how interesting the content is.  Specifically, runtime, release date, availability, and star ratings.<p /> When it comes to performance, many apps lack a cache of information even though the Netflix API allows for it.  This greatly speeds up boot time of the app as well as resource loading.  Also, such caching prevents the reload of detailed information about resources when the user moves back from a detail view and then reloads it just afterward.<p /> I set out to solve these problems for myself by writing a fairly thorough application.  My previous posts about iOS programming patterns came about largely due to this app.  Here is a breakdown of how I solved these problems: In design, the app is very visual: you see large, friendly box art rather than a list of titles.  In information architecture, the pieces of information you really use to make decisions about what to watch is bubbled up to the surface, rather than buried below a tap.  There are also lots of performance related features in the software to make sure the app boots fast and stays fast throughout.<p /> I&#39;m about to launch a beta of the application.  I&#39;d love to get feedback.  If you&#39;d like to participate, please fill out this survey: <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/syfterbeta">http://www.tinyurl.com/syfterbeta</a><p /> ~s</p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p>In a <a href="http://blog.brokenrobotllc.com/how-apple-tv-could-have-been-awesome">previous post,</a> I talked about how I think Apple TV should have been made.  One of the features I like the most is the idea of an expansion port that iOS applications could access.  I wanted to take the time to elaborate on that idea as I think it has the ability to be a disruption, especially for game console platform holders.<p /> What value do console platform holders give to their customers?  For that matter, who are their customers?  They actually have four classes of them: consumers, publishers, developers and retail distributors.  The platform holders provide different value to each of them.  Also, let&#39;s distinguish a publisher as the entity that wants to make money selling games, while the developer is an altruistic entity that just wants to make a great game.<p /> To the retail distributor, they provide an ecosystem of products to sell at a profit.  Note the word ecosystem: video game consoles are sold at a loss and distributors make money by selling software.  In return for this ecosystem, the distributor provides the platform holder with physical reach for consoles: even if all the games in the world were digitally distributed, console makers still need physical retailers to put the console into your home.  Apple excels here, of course, as they have a bunch of Apple Stores.<p /> To the publisher, a console provides an install base of users to reach and the distribution channels to reach them.  Previously, there was only one distribution channel: the game image (on a disc or in a cartridge).  Now, there are a few given the various channels of downloadable content available.<p /> To the developer and the consumer, consoles provide special value: they solve the interaction problem at scale.  For developers, a scalable solution is one that lots of users are able to use - all the more whom developers may be able to influence through their games.  To consumers, a scalable solution allows them to interact with and control as many experiences as possible, thus maximizing an initial investment in a video game console.<p /> So in review, the only unique problem being solved by a game console platform holder is the interaction problem.  The others are a question of sales and distribution, and they are usually the most expensive problems to solve as they become chicken-and-egg scenarios.  Without potential for profitability, distributors have no incentive to let a platform holder leverage their reach.  And without reach, the platform holder can&#39;t offer the potential for profitability.<p /> Through its Apple Stores, Apple has attained as much reach as one could need, and through the App Store, provides a marketplace that removes the middle man distributor.  That leaves the interaction problem.  Apple would love to solve the interaction problem for the purpose of users accessing their movies, music, etc.  They&#39;ve tried to do this with the five button remote.  However, Apple hasn&#39;t gone beyond that and I don&#39;t think they want to do so.<p /> An expansion port on an Apple TV device would make it much cheaper to become a video game platform holder by allowing them to leverage Apple&#39;s distribution of Apple TVs.  The platform holder would no longer need to provide an ecosystem of profitability to distributors as the hardware would no longer serve as a loss-leader: it could be sold anywhere.  Games are net-neutral as they have the same incentives to use platform hardware as they always did.  Consumers are happier since they get to choose the kind of interaction they want without investing in multiple, expensive consoles.  Ultimately, this allow platform holders to focus more of their attention on why they truly entered the business in the first place: building great human-computer interaction.<p /> ~s</p>
